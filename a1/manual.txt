// =============================================== How to Compile ====================================

This is a C++ program and to compile all you need to do is type the following command in the terminal:
                        g++ jorgeProxy.cpp -o proxy
It will take a half a second to compile because im using the regex library and it is huge.
There should be no errors or warning when compiling


// ========================================== How to use or run the proxy ====================================

To use the proxy just make sure you compile the code forst and then type the following command in the terminal:
                                ./proxy 1234
The number after the ./proxy is customixable and 1234 was just an example. I recommend to use any number above 2000 and below 10000
since i tested my code with numbers in his range and got a weird message when tried numbers bigger than 65000


// ==================================================== How to Configure ====================================

You can use any modern web browser to configure the proxy but I recomment using Firefox
since it is very easy to configre a custom proxy and this is the browser I used for my testing
so using a diferent browser might give different results

To configure a custom web proxy in Firefox open the menu located at the top right corner,
then click preferences.
Once inside preference look for the search option and type proxy.
This will take you to the network settings and click on the settings button.
This will open another menu where you have to click the Manual Proxy Configuration option and enter the
Http proxy and port number.

For the HTTP proxy you have to enter you current IP address. This can be done by typing the following command in the terminal:
                                   ifconfig  
*****this command only works for linux and macOS computers. I am assuming one of these two OS will be used to test this proxy
After typing this command look for the numbers after the word inet and before netmask to know what is your current IP address:
for example: inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 ---- 127.0.0.1 is the IP address i would enter into the HTTP proxy textfield

For the Proxy number you have to enter the same number you used when you ran the proxy.
So if you used 1234 then enter 1234 in the port number.
 
After this just press ok and you are ready to test the proxy. It a better idea do this step before you run the proxy but either way works.


// ========================== Testing and supported Features ====================================
 I did most of my testing in school using the linux computers but I tested it at home using my local network and Mac computer terminal
 This proxy supports the main features required for the assignment:
 It changes all ocurrences of the word "Floppy" to "Trolly", changed all instances of "Italy" to "Japan" and replaces all the jgp images 
 referencing Floppy into a troll meme jpg. 

 (The only Floopy instance I didnt change was floppy-eared beacuase i didnt think it made sense to say trolly-eared.
 but my code can very easily do that i just changed my regex search to look for "Floppy" instead of any version of the word. I dont know if thats an issue but 
 I its something i can make happen by adding one char to my regex search. Jus wanted to clarify this).

This proxy also supporst the bonus feature to change "Italy" to "Germany" and it doesnt without altering the format of the html.
the only problem I found when testing this feature is that sometimes the page took a little longer to load. However, this only happen when testing at home 
and not at campus.

I dont know what the first bonus meant but i tried to test my site with the Italy wikipedia page, but it didnt work because this pages uses https and 
it bypasses my proxy. I didint know how if if i had to fix this issue in order to get the first bonus mark
