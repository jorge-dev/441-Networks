                                How to compile the program: 
            g++ a4.cpp -o "choose a name"

                                How to run: 
There are 3 running options: 
    1. ./a4 --- this assumes the N is 3 and song durations is # minutes
    2. ./a4 N --- n will be the desired number of birds and song duration will be 3 minutes
    3. ./a4 N S --- here S is the desired song duration

                                Testing:  
            I used the values of N from 1 to 29  and 3 different song durations 2,3, and 5
